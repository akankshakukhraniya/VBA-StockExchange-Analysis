  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.

## Other Considerations

* Make sure that the script acts the same on each sheet. The joy of VBA is to take the tediousness out of repetitive task and run over and over again with a click of the button.

## Results
* Results can be viewed under Images folder (moderate_solution_results & hard_solution_results)
* Solved VBA script can be found under Resources folder with name moderate_solution_code.txt & hard_solution_code.txt
